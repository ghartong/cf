				<h2>Ground Transportation</h2>
				<p>Upon arrival at Orlando International Airport, please proceed to the baggage claim area where a representative from Mears Transportation will greet you. Mears Representatives will be wearing a yellow polo and holding a sign with the Managers’ Leadership Conference Logo. After claiming your luggage, follow the instructions of the uniformed Mears staff. No gratuity is necessary. If no one meets your flight due to delays, etc., please proceed to the Mears curbside area for pick up. Please keep your carry-on luggage with you at all times.</p>
				<p>Transportation from the airport will be provided to both Disney's Coronado Springs Resort and Disney's Port Orleans Resort - Riverside.</p>
				<p>Signet will provide shuttles to and from the housing and conference hotels throughout the week for our attendees’ convenience.</p>

				<h2>Luggage</h2>
				<p>Please be sure your luggage is checked to your final destination. The final destination on your luggage claim check should read Orlando International Airport (MCO) from your city of origin.</p>
				<p>Luggage Allowance: Most airlines allow two checked suitcases per person, plus one carry-on item, which must fit under your seat or in the overhead compartment.</p>
				<p>Signet will only reimburse travelers for ONE of the airline’s checked bag fees.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Signet will not cover the fees for overweight bags.</li>
					<li>Signet will provide you with one Signet luggage tag. Additional details about when to place this on your luggage will be included in your conference Information you will receive two weeks prior to departure.</li>
					<li>A detailed expense report with proper receipts must be submitted within 90 days following the conference to receive reimbursement. Expense reports submitted without receipts will be returned for re-submission.
						<ul>
							<li>Expense Report should be charged to the following account numbers/cost centers
								<ul>
									<li>Akron Brands: 10-470-4</li>

						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Packing Tips</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>TSA suggests that you do not lock your luggage, due to the screening process. You may keep your bags locked if you choose, but TSA is not liable for damage caused to locked bags that must be opened for security purposes.</li>
					<li>Avoid over-packing your bags. This will make it easier for the screener to reseal your bag if it is opened for inspection. If possible, spread your contents over your bags. Check with your airline for maximum weight limitations and any fees that may apply.</li>
					<li>Always carry necessary medication and valuables with you in your carry-on luggage and be sure to keep it with you at all times while traveling. Once at the hotel, safes are located in your room, and safety deposit boxes are available free of charge at the front desk.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>To provide peace of mind while you are away, please refer to this last-minute checklist before you go:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Be sure to bring proper Government-Issued Photo ID (passport if required)</li>
					<li>Verify that your identification and travel documents, medication (along with a copy of your prescription from a physician), health insurance card, jewelry, camera, cash and other valuables are with you in a carry-on bag so they are available at all times.</li>
					<li>Leave copies of your ID, flight itineraries, and any credit cards you plan to use with a family member or trusted friend.</li>
					<li>Inform your bank or credit card company that you are traveling to avoid any challenges with using your credit card.</li>
					<li>Place a card with your name and address inside your baggage as well as using your Signet Luggage Tag on the outside of your baggage.</li>
					<li>Have the post office hold your mail. Also, stop your newspaper delivery or have a friend or neighbor take them in for you.</li>
